## Using the US Population dataset from 1790 to 1970
data(uspop)

## Looking at the first 3 rows
head(uspop,3)

## Sequencing the years by 10
x <- seq(1790,1970, by=10)


## Combining the data and creating tibble
us_pop <- cbind(x,uspop)
us_pop <- as_tibble(us_pop)

## Renaming the x as year
names(us_pop)[names(us_pop)=="x"] <- "year"


## Plotting the graph to see the pattern
plot(us_pop$year,us_pop$uspop)

#splitting into groups for t-test
less_or_equal_1870 <- us_pop[us_pop$year<="1870",]
greater_1870 <- us_pop[us_pop$year>"1870",]

## Conducting t-test
t.test(greater_1870$uspop, less_or_equal_1870$uspop)

## Null hypothesis of the average of both groups are equal is rejected by p<5%, indicating the averages of both groups are different
